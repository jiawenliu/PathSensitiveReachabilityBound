%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
  Reachability-bound analysis aims at providing upper bounds on the number of times a given program location is visited during program execution.
  This paper presents a path-sensitive reachability-bound algorithm.
  In comparison with previous works, 
  our algorithm is the first one to exploit path-sensitivity to compute precise reachability-bounds for every program location.
  By doing this, we bring together two techniques from resource analysis:
  1. amortized bound analysis through program abstraction and ranking function estimation, and
  2. summarization-based multiple loop paths refinement.
  Building on this combination, we focus on two new quantities, \emph{path reachability-bound} and \emph{loop reachability-bound}, which allow us to leverage the precision and efficiency of the two techniques,
  and allow us to compute precise reachability-bounds for each program point in a path-sensitive way.
  We implemented our algorithm in a prototype and we report on an experimental comparison with state-of-art tools over four different sets of benchmarks.
