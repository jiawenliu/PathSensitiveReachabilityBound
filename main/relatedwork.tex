% \subsection{Cost Analysis}

\paragraph*{Program Model.}
The semantics model mainly inspired from~\cite{Cousot19a} and~\cite{Cousot19}.
The program abstraction and the abstraction transition graph are inspired from~\cite{SinnZV17}.

There are many other program abstraction techniques, but not efficient and accurate enough.

\paragraph{Type-Based Static Cost Analysis.}
\paragraph{Program Cost Analysis.}
The works in analyzing the program complexity~\cite{GustafssonEL05, HumenbergerJK18} only focus on estimating 
the overall complexity 
by inferring the bounds on the loop iteration numbers.
Similarly, the algorithm of computing a program's worst-case resource cost
such as~\cite{BrockschmidtEFFG16, AlbertAGP08, AliasDFG10, Flores-MontoyaH14} reason the worst-case running time and resource cost of the program's entire execution as well.

The CofloCo~\cite{Montoya17, Flores-MontoyaH14, Flores-Montoya16},

The loop bound analysis algorithm in~\cite{LuCT21} works well in but not in multi-paths loops.
\paragraph{Loop Summarization and Termination.}
Termination~\cite{FalkeKS12, FalkeKS11},
Loop summarization and invariant generate~\cite{HumenbergerJK18}.
Invariant Generation Through Ranking functions~\cite{AliasDFG10} for multipath loops.
Closed-form loop summarization techniques~\cite{KincaidBCR19} which can help to improve the accuracy of the path refinement.
Non-linear loop summarization techniques~\cite{KincaidCBR18} we plan to extend in the future.
Advanced loop summarization considering recurrence in~\cite{BreckCKR20}.
\paragraph{Path Refinement.}
\cite{GulwaniJK09}
Path refinement algorithm we are using.
\cite{SinnZV14}
The contextualization path refinement algorithm, based on the loop termination techniques in~\todo{}.
\cite{CyphertBKR19}
Advanced path refinement techniques we plan to extend in the future.
