In this section, we discuss two representative examples with
challenges of analyzing the symbolic
\emph{reachability-bound} on
every control location.
We also give the technique overview of our algorithm.
%
\subsection{Multiple-Path Loop}
\label{sec:overview-multiplepath}
\input{examples/whileTwoCounters-overview}
Figure~\ref{fig:whileTwoCounters-overview}(a) shows an example of a two paths loops
with different \emph{reachability-bounds} on the control locations in different paths.
This example is adopted from the example in~\cite{GulwaniZ10}, which
is a skeleton code from the .Net base-class library.
\\
In this example, given $n \geq m$,
the precise \emph{reachability-bound}s for control locations $4$ and $5$ are both $m \times \lfloor\frac{n}{m}\rfloor$,
for location $2$ and $3$ are $(m + 1) \times \lfloor\frac{n}{m}\rfloor + 1$, 
and $1$ for locations $0, 1$ and $\lex$. 
\highlight{Notice here, though within the same loop $L_2$, the bounds for locations $4$ and $5$ on the first branch, and $6$ on the second branch are different.}
% \\
% In order to know that the locations in first branch ($4$ and $5$) are reached at most $m \times \lfloor\frac{n}{m}\rfloor$ times
% while $6$ in second branch $\lfloor\frac{n}{m}\rfloor$ times
%  during program execution,
% we need to know that the two if branches are interleaved and executed alternatively after each other
% during the iterations of the enclosed loop.
\\
However, the state-of-art \emph{reachability-bound} analysis~\cite{GulwaniZ10}
gives the same \emph{reachability-bound}, $n + \lfloor\frac{n}{m}\rfloor$ for all the locations within the loop $L_2$, which is tight w.r.t. $L_2$'s iteration times but not for different locations inside $L_2$ without considering multiple paths.
Among works on program complexity, cost and loop bound analysis, \cite{GulwaniJK09} can also compute the tight bound on the loop iteration but not reachability-bound on each location path-sensitively.
Though we can use it as the \emph{reachability-bound} for location $1$ and $2$,
the \emph{reachability-bounds} for control locations $4, 5$ and $6$ are still unclear.
\paragraph{Path Reachability-bound}
To compute the bounds for locations on different paths of a loop, we compute the \emph{path reachability-bound},
which is the first key idea of this path-sensitive \emph{reachability-bound} analysis algorithm. This bound approximate the evaluation times of each loop free path instead of the entire multipath loop.
\\
% Our algorithm combines the idea of \emph{difference constraint} based program complexity analysis method from \cite{SinnZV17}
% and the control-flow refinement technique from~\cite{GulwaniJK09}.
For this example, we first
generate the abstract transition graph for the program using the difference constraints, such as Figure~\ref{fig:whileTwoCounters-overview}(b).
Then it transforms every the loop in $\kw{twoPathsWhile}$ using the control-flow refinement technique from~\cite{GulwaniJK09} and generates a refined program $\rprog$ as
\\
% 
% The refined program for program $\kw{twoPathsWhile}$ is
% \[
  $
  \tpath_0 ; 
  \rpchoose{2: \rprepeat_2(\rprepeat_1(\tpath_1); \tpath_2), 
  2: \rprepeat_1(\tpath_1)}; \tpath_3.
  $
% \]
\\
Each $\tpath_i$ in this refined program is a \emph{simple transition path} we computed in a pre-procedure, which is loop free and not interleave with the other $\tpath_j, j \neq i$ as in Figure~\ref{fig:whileTwoCounters-overview}(c).
% Every path will not interleave with the others. 
Then we compute the \emph{path reachability-bound} for every $\tpath_i$,
$\inoutB(\rprog, \tpath_i)$ during the execution of $\rprog$.
% which is a bound on the reachability time of $\tpath$ during the execution of $\rprog$.
The \emph{path reachability-bound}s for the four simple transition paths in this example are
$\inoutB(\rprog, \tpath_1) = \max\{m, m \times \lfloor\frac{n}{m}\rfloor\}$,
$\inoutB(\rprog, \tpath_2) = \lfloor\frac{n}{m}\rfloor$,
and $\inoutB(\rprog, \tpath_0) = \inoutB(\rprog, \tpath_3) = 1$.
% \\
% Then we use this bounds
% and another \emph{loop reachability-bound}
% to compute the final \emph{reachability-bound} for each location.
Since there isn't nested loop in this example, we simply sum up $\inoutB(\rprog, \tpath)$ over the $\tpath$ where a certain location shows up
and as the \emph{reachability-bound} of this location.
Then we get the precise \emph{reachability-bound} for every location in program $\kw{twoPathsWhile}$ as
$\psRB(0) = \psRB(1) = \psRB(\lex) = 1$,
$\psRB(4) = \psRB(5) = \max\{m, m \times \lfloor\frac{n}{m}\rfloor\}$,
$\psRB(3) = \psRB(2) = \max\{m, m \times \lfloor\frac{n}{m}\rfloor\} + \lfloor\frac{n}{m}\rfloor + 1 $,
and $\psRB(6) = \lfloor\frac{n}{m}\rfloor$.
%
\subsection{Nested Loops with Related Iterator}
\label{sec:overview-nestedwhile}
However, when there exists nested loop, computing the \emph{reachability-bound} for each location encounters another challenge.
The \emph{path reachability-bound} is precise for each path w.r.t. the innermost loop but not the outer nested loops.
Figure~\ref{fig:threeWhile-overview}(a) shows an example of the nested loops with related 
iterators.
This example is adopted from the example in~\cite{GulwaniJK09}, which is common in product code.
\\
In line 8, $i$ is reset by $w$ and $w$ is reset by $j$ at line 5. So the
while $L_6$ is only executed in the first iteration of while loop $L_1$ and $L_3$.
% \\
The while loop $L_3$ at line 3 is executed only in 
the first $m - N$ iterations of the 
$L_1$ because $j$ is reset by $i$ in line 2.
% \\
So the total iterations of all the three loops is
$n + m^2 - m \times N$,
and the precise \emph{reachability-bound} for location $7$ inside the $L_6$ is $N$,
for locations $4, 5$ and $8$ between the $L_3$ and $L_6$ are $(n-N) \times (m - N)$,
and $n - N$ for locations $2$ and $9$.
% \\
\highlight{Notice here the \emph{reachability-bounds} for the locations inside the loop $L_6$ is 
the same as its innermost loop iteration bound.
% , as well as our \emph{path reachability-bound}.
However, for the locations between $L_3$ and $L_6$,
the \emph{reachability-bounds} are the multiplication of the inner and outer loop iteration bounds.}
\\
To the best of our knowledge, the loop bound analysis method in \cite{GulwaniJK09} can only give a loose bound $n + (m \times n) + N$ for the entire loop complexity, and 
the DC-based algorithm in \cite{SinnZV17} is able to
compute a better but still loose bound, $n + m^2 - m \times N$ on total iteration times.
None of them can give the precise \emph{reachability-bound} for every location in these nested loops,
which is non-trivial to compute even though knowing the loop bound,
especially for the locations similar to $7$ in $\kw{threeNestedWhile}$.
\\
\highlight{
In order to precisely compute how many times the location $7$ is reached, we need to know
the numbers of iterations of the outside loop $L_3$ and $L_1$ such that,
during these iterations, the loop $L_6$ is ``entered''. 
We call this the \emph{loop reachability} of the location within loop $L_6$ w.r.t the loops $L_3$ and $L_1$.
Then by multiplying the loop iteration bound of the $L_6$ with its \emph{loop reachability} times w.r.t the  $L_3$ and $L_1$, we can compute the precise
\emph{reachability-bounds} for location $7$.
}
\\
\highlight{
This quantity isn't considered or computed in any of the previous works.
The \emph{Progress Invariant} method in \cite{GulwaniJK09} is only able to compute
the
bound on iteration numbers
of the inner loop $L_6$ in each iteration of $L_3$ and $L_1$, which are both $N$.
So they have to over-approximate the reachability-bound for locations inside $L_6$ with the
overall program complexity by multiplication, i.e., $n + m^2 - m \times N$.
% \\
For the same reason, the DC-based algorithm in \cite{SinnZV17}
is only able to
compute the combined loop bound and the local bound of each loop
separately as well.
% We are still unable to know the precise \emph{reachability-bound} for the locations in the innermost loop.
}
\paragraph*{Loop reachability-bound.}
In this sense, this \emph{loop reachability-bound}, $\lpchB(L:\rprog, \tpath)$ is our second key idea.
For each transition path $\tpath$ w.r.t each of the loops $L:\rprog$ in which $\tpath$ is nested,
$\lpchB(L:\rprog, \tpath)$ 
\highlight{is a bound on the iterations for
the outside loop, $L:\rprog$ w.r.t. the innermost loop where $\tpath$ is enclosed,
such that during these iterations of $L:\rprog$, the innermost loop is ``entered''. 
This is distinguished from the traditional methods, which only estimate the bound on the inner loop's iteration number
in one iteration of the outside loop.}
\\
Similar to the $\kw{twoPathsWhile}$ example, we also generate its abstract transition graph as well in Figure~\ref{fig:threeWhile-overview}(a),
and compute its refined program,
$\rprog = \tpath_0; 1: \rprepeat(\tpath_1;$ 
$3: {\rprepeat(\tpath_2; 6 : {\rprepeat(\tpath_3)}; \tpath_4)}; \tpath_5);$ 
$\tpath_6$,
where the $\tpath_0, \ldots$ are shown in the middle part of Figure~\ref{fig:threeWhile-overview}(b).
We use $\rprog_1$ and $\rprog_3$ denote the body of the loop $L_1$ and $L_3$ respectively as in the bottom part of Figure~\ref{fig:threeWhile-overview}(b).
% to denote ${\rprepeat(\tpath_1; 3: {\rprepeat(\tpath_2; 6 : {\rprepeat(\tpath_3)}; \tpath_4)}; \tpath_5)}$
% and $\rprog_3 = {\rprepeat(\tpath_2; 6 : {\rprepeat(\tpath_3)}; \tpath_4)}$
In the first step, we still compute the \emph{path reachability-bound} for each $\tpath_i$ but only w.r.t. the closest loop it is nested.
Then differently from $\kw{twoPathsWhile}$,
we compute \emph{loop reachability-bound} for each $\tpath_i$ w.r.t. each of its outer nested loops.
For example, for $\tpath_3$ we compute
$\lpchB(1: \rprog_1, \tpath_3) = 1$ and
$\lpchB(3: \rprog_3, \tpath_3) = 1$.
Both are tight because loop $L_6$ will only be entered once among all iterations of $L_1$ and $L_3$, and in all the rest iterations, the body of loop $L_6$ isn't executed at all.
So $1$ as \emph{loop reachability-bound} of this path is tight w.r.t. both the loop $L_3$ and $L_1$.
% In the same way, we also compute $\lpchB(3: \rprog_3, \tpath_3) = 1$ precisely.
Then for each $\tpath_i$, the multiplication of its \emph{path reachability-bound} with all its \emph{loop reachability-bound}s is an accurate \emph{loop reachability-bound} for the locations on this path.
By summing up the reachability-bound of the path where each location shows up,
% as its \emph{reachability-bound} as before.
% and multiply this result by all its \emph{loop reachability-bound}s.
% In this way, 
we compute $N$ as the \emph{reachability-bound} of location $7$, which is tight.
