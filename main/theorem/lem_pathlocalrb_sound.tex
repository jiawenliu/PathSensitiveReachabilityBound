\emph{Path Local Reachability Bound}  $\outinB(\rprog, \tpath)$.
For a simple transition path $\tpath$ with its closest enclosing while loop at $l$ in a program $\rprog$, 
$\outinB(\rprog, \tpath)$
is a sound bound on its execution times in side $l$.
\\
For a simple transition path $\tpath$ only enclosed by one transition path $\rprepeat(\tpath)$, 
we know $\outinB(\rprog, \tpath) = \outinB(\rprepeat(\tpath), \rprog)$.
Since $\outinB(\rprepeat(\tpath), \rprog)$ is a sound local bound on the iteration times
of $\rprepeat(\tpath)$ by assuming all the outside loops executes only once.
In this sense, $\outinB(\rprepeat(\tpath), \rprog)$ is also a sound bound on the iteration times globally.
\\
For a simple transition path $\tpath$ nested in multiple transition paths $\rprog_1, \cdots, \rprog_m$,
we know $\outinB(\rprog, \tpath) = \prod\limits_{i = 1, \cdots, m}\outinB(\rprog_i, \rprog)$.
By the same guarantee from $\outinB(\rprog_i, \rprog)$, it is sound to multiply each of them.
