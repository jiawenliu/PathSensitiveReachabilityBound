\begin{lem}[Soundness of Path Reachability Bound]
    For every program $c$ with it refined program $\rprog$ and 
    every simple transition path $\tpath$ in this program,
     the $\inoutB(\tpath, \rprog)$
  is a sound bound on the execution times of $\tpath$ in $c$.

      \begin{array}{l}
      \forall c \in \cdom, \tpath \in \absG(c), \trace_0 \in \tdom_0(c), \trace \in \tdom, \rprog \st

      \rprog = Alg.4(c)

      \implies

  \emph{Soundness} of the \emph{Path Reachability Bound}  
For every simple transition path $\tpath$, the $\inoutB(\tpath, \rprog)$
is a sound upper bound on its execution times globally.
\\
In every base case, a simple transition path not nested in any loop, or just inside one loop.
Then $\inoutB(\tpath, \rprog) = \outinB(\rprog, \tpath)$, which is the bound on its execution times without considering
outside loops' executions. Since there isn't any outside loop, this operation is sound.
In the same time, the soundness is guaranteed by the $\outinB(\rprog, \tpath)$.
\\
For every simple transition path nested in multiple loops, if $l$ is the closest loop $\tpath$ comes from, then
$\inoutB(\tpath, \rprog) =
\prod\limits_{l' \in \lpch(\tpath, \rprog)} \rpchB(l', \tpath, \rprog) \times \outinB(\rprog, \tpath)$.
Since $\lpchB(l', \tpath, \rprog)$ bounds the number of $l'$'s iteration numbers,
%  will 
% bound the execution times of $L_{t_0}$
% in each single execution of the $L_{t_i}$ for every
such that during these iterations, the $\tpath$ will be executed,
it is sound to multiply these bounds by $\outinB(\rprog, \tpath)$.
In the same time, the soundness also relies on the soundness of $\outinB(\rprog, \tpath)$ and $\rpchB(l', \tpath, \rprog)$.
