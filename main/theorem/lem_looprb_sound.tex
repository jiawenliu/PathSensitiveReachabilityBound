In a refined program $\rprog$,
for its every loop at the program point $l$ and a transition path $\tpath$ inside this loop,
the \emph{Relative Loop Bound} $\lpchB(l: \rprog, \tpath)$ is a symbolic bound
on the number of $l$'s iteration numbers,
%  will 
% bound the execution times of $L_{t_0}$
% in each single execution of the $L_{t_i}$ for every
such that during these iterations, the closest loop $l'$ enclosing $\tpath$ will be executed.
\\
The soundness is guaranteed by the operation
 $\frac{\lpinit(\rprog, \tpath) - \rffinal(\rprog, \tpath)}{\lpinit(\rprog, \tpath) - \lpnext(\rprog, \tpath)}$.
 In this operation, $\lpnext(\rprog, \tpath)$ computes the variables states of the $\tpath$
after visited the program point $l$ the second time and before visiting any other program point.

In the same time, the soundness also relies on an external solver.
