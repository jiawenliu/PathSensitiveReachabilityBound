For each program point in a program $c$, $l \in \lvar(c)$,
%  in a program $c$,
its \emph{path-sensitive reachability-bound} ($\psRB(c, l)$ is a symbolic sound bound on the executing times of $l$ during the execution of $c$.
%
 \begin{defn}[Path-Sensitive Reachability Bound]
  \label{def:label_psrb}
  Given a program $c$ with its \emph{Abstract Transition Graph}, $\absG(c)$ and refined program $\rprog$,
  the \emph{reachability bound} of each program point $l \in \lvar(c)$, $\psRB(c, l)$ 
  sums up all the path reachability bounds, $\inoutB(\rprog, \tpath)$ over the $\tpath$ which contains the program point $l$.
  \[ 
    \psRB(c, l) = 
    \sum\limits_{\tpath \in \rprog \land 
  l \in \tpath} 
  \inoutB(\rprog, \tpath)
  \]
  $l \in \tpath$ denotes program point $l$ is a vertex on $\tpath$ 
  and $\tpath \in \rprog$ denotes $\tpath$ is a simple transition path of program $c$.
 \end{defn}

\begin{thm}[Soundness of the Path-sensitive Reachability Bound Estimation]
    \label{thm:pathsensitive_rb_soundness}
  For every program ${c}$ and every label $l$ in this program,
  $\config{\psRB(c, l)}$ is a \emph{Reachability-Bound} for $l$ in $c$.
  %
  \[
    \forall c \in \cdom, \trace_0 \in \tdom_0(c), \trace \in \tdom \st 
    \config{{c}, \trace} \to^{*} \config{\eskip, \trace_0 \tracecat \vtrace} 
    \implies \config{\psRB(c, l)}(\trace_0) \geq \counter(\vtrace, l) 
    \]
  \end{thm}
Proof of this theorem is in Appendix~\ref{apdx:pathsensitive_rb_soundness}.
