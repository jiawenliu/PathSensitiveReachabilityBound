We presented a path-sensitive reachability-bound computation algorithm.
This algorithm can compute the evaluation times of each program point accurately and path-sensitively.
We also implemented this algorithm as a prototype and evaluated it over 5 different benchmarks.
The evaluation results show that we can compute tight bound on the evaluation times of each program point in a program. For program with multi-path loop, we computed different bounds for the points on different paths.

The efficiency is our main concern, we will improve the efficiency of the algorithm by reducing the recursions in path-refinement algorithm and ranking functions estimation, and also extend the language syntax
% and the prototype implementation 
to be more scalable.
