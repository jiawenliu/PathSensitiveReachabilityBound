We presented a path-sensitive reachability-bound computation algorithm.
This algorithm can compute accurately the number of times that each program point is executed.
We also implemented this algorithm as a prototype and evaluated it over 4 different benchmark sets including 200+ programs.
The results show both the effectiveness of our approach in estimating the reachability-bound of each program point and improvements in terms of estimation of the the overall program complexity. 
In the future, we plan to further apply this technique into other areas such as data analysis, security and privacy.
