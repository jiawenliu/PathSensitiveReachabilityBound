Based on the \emph{Abstract Transition Graph}, $\absG(c)$, the \emph{Refined Program}, $\rprog$ and the upper bound invariant for the \emph{Ranking Function} computed previously for a program $c$, our algorithm first requires to compute the new quantities, \emph{Path Reachability-bound} and the \emph{Loop Reachability-bound}. This section introduces the algorithm and the following sections describe how we compute them.

% As pre-procedures, we first need to compute the loop bound, $BD(\rprog', c) \in \scexpr(c)$ for every subprogram $\rprog'$ of $c$ in $\rprog$, and use it to estimate the \emph{path local reachability-bound}, $\outinB(\rprog_l, \tpath, c) \in \scexpr(c)$ for each $\tpath$ w.r.t. the sub loop program $\rprog_l$.
As pre-procedures, we first compute the loop bound, $BD(\rprog_l, c)$ for every loop program $\rprog_l$ of $c$ in $\rprog$ and the local \emph{path reachability-bound}.
% and use it to estimate the \emph{path local reachability-bound}, $\outinB(\rprog_l, \tpath, c) \in \scexpr(c)$.
%  for each $\tpath$ w.r.t. the sub loop program $\rprog_l$.
\begin{defn}[Loop Bound]
  % \label{def:loopbound}
  For any program $c$ with it refined program $\rprog$,
  the loop bound $BD(\rprog_l, c) \in \scexpr(c)$ for a subprogram $\rprog_l$ of $c$ in $\rprog$ is an upper bound on the iterating times of this program from its enter point to the exit point.
\end{defn}
% 
% Then we compute the \emph{path local reachability-bound}, $\outinB(\rprog_l, \tpath, c) \in \scexpr(c)$ for every sub loop program $\rprog_l$ of $c$ in $\rprog$.
\begin{defn}[Local Path Reachability-bound]
  % \label{def:pathlocalrb}
  Given program $c$ with its refined program $\rprog$ and a simple transition path $\tpath$ in this program, 
  let $l: \rprog_l = \kw{enclosed}(\rprog, \tpath)$ be a sub loop program in $\rprog$,
  then $\tpath$'s \emph{path local reachability-bound} w.r.t. $l: \rprog_l$,  $\outinB(\rprog_l, \tpath, c) \in \scexpr(c)$
  is an upper bound on the execution times of $\tpath$ when executing program $\rprog$.
\end{defn}
Intuitively,
$\outinB(\rprog_l, \tpath, c)$ bounds the execution times of $\tpath$ when only its innermost loop program $\rprog_l$ is executing.
% and $\rprog$ is the closest loop where $\tpath$ is nested.
For example in the first interleaving pattern $\rprog_1^1$ in Example~\ref{ex:relatedNestedWhileOdd-overview}, 
$4:\rprepeat(\tpath_3)$ is the innermost loop program of $\tpath_3$. So we first compute $m - n$ as its local \emph{path reachability-bound} to bound its iteration times in its closest loop by Section~\ref{sec:pathlocalrb}.

Next, we define the \emph{loop reachability-bound},
$\lpchB(l: \rprog_l, \tpath, c) \in \scexpr(c)$ for every outer loop program $\rprog_l$ of $\tpath$ in $\rprog$. This quantity aims to precisely bound the iteration numbers of the outer loop $l$,
such that,
during these iterations, the innermost loop $\kw{enclosed(\tpath)}$ is executed, i.e., reached.
\begin{defn}[Loop Reachability-bound]
% \label{def:looprb}
For a program with its refined program $\rprog$ and a simple transition path $\tpath$ in this program, 
let $l: \rprog_l$ be a loop program in $\rprog$,
then $l: \rprog_l$'s \emph{loop reachability-bound} w.r.t. $\tpath$,  $\lpchB(l: \rprog_l, \tpath, c) \in \scexpr(c)$
is the upper bound on iteration numbers of the outside loop $l$,
such that,
during these iterations, the nested loop $l' = \kw{enclosed(\tpath)}$ is entered.
\end{defn}
In Example~\ref{ex:relatedNestedWhileOdd-overview}, $\tpath_3$ has an outer loop $\rprog_1^1$. Since $L_4$ will be ``entered'' only in the first iteration of $\rprog_1^1$,
we aim to compute $1$ for $\lpchB(\rprog_1^1, \tpath_3, c)$ in Section~\ref{sec:looprb}.
  % and we compute $\lpchB(\rprog_1^1, \tpath_3, c) = 1$. It is tight because the innermost loop of $\tpath_3$ will be ``entered'' only in the first iteration of $\rprog_1^1$.

% Intuitively $\lpchB(l: \rprog_l, \tpath, c) \in \scexpr(c)$
% is the bound on iteration numbers of the outside loop $l$,
% such that,
% during these iterations, the nested loop $l' = \kw{enclosed(\tpath)}$ is executed, i.e., reached.
The \emph{path reachability-bound}, $\inoutB(\rprog, \tpath, c)$ for each $\tpath$
aims to bound the execution times of $\tpath$ globally
% during the execution of $c$ 
and Section~\ref{sec:pathrb} presents the computation.
%
\begin{defn}[Path Reachability-bound]
% \label{def:pathrb}
For a program $c$ with its refined program $\rprog$ and a simple transition path $\tpath$ in this program, 
the \emph{path reachability-bound}, $\inoutB(\rprog, \tpath, c) \in \scexpr(c)$ is the upper bound on the
times that $\tpath$ is executed when executing $c$.
\end{defn}
% Intuitively, $\inoutB(\rprog, \tpath)$ bounds the execution times of $\tpath$ globally during the execution of $c$.
%
In Example~\ref{ex:relatedNestedWhileOdd-overview}, since there isn't outer loop for $\tpath_1$ and $\tpath_2$, we aim to compute $\frac{m}{4}$, which is the same as their local bound.
While $\tpath_3$ is nested in two loops, but only visited once in the outer iteration, we still aim to compute $\frac{m}{4} \times 1$.
% by multiplying its local $\inoutB(\rprepeat(\tpath_3), \tpath_3, c)$ with the loop reachability bound.
% path is $\tpath_3 = \frac{m}{4} \times 1 = \frac{m}{4} $.

Then we compute for each program point in a program $c$, $l \in \lvar(c)$,
%  in a program $c$,
its \emph{reachability-bound}, $\psRB(l, c)$ by summing up all the path reachability bounds over all simple transition paths that contains $l$.
%
\begin{defn}[The Reachability-bound Computation]
\label{def:point_psrb}
Given a program $c$ with its {abstract transition graph}, $\absG(c)$ and refined program $\rprog$,
the \emph{reachability bound} of each program point $l \in \lvar(c)$, $\psRB(l, c)$  is computed as follows,
% sums up all the path reachability bounds, $\inoutB(\rprog, \tpath, c)$ over all simple transition paths $\tpath$ that contains the program point $l$.
\[ 
  \psRB(l, c) = 
  \sum
  \left\{ \inoutB(\rprog, \tpath, c) ~\vert~ \tpath \in \rprog \land 
  l \in \pathl(\tpath) \right\}
  % \footnotemark
\]
$\tpath \in \rprog$ denotes $\tpath$ is a simple transition path in $\absG(c)$.
% \footnotetext{$l \in \tpath$ and $\tpath \in \rprog$ denote $l$ is a vertex on $\tpath$, and $\tpath$ is a path on $\rprog$ respectively.}
\end{defn}
$\econfig{\psRB(l, c)}$ is a \emph{reachability-bound} for every program point $l$ in a program $c$.
\begin{thm}[Soundness]
\label{thm:pathsensitive_rb_soundness}
For every program ${c}$ and every label $l$ in this program,
$\econfig{\psRB(l, c)}$ is a \emph{Reachability-bound} for $l$ in $c$.
