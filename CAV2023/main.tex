\begin{abstract}
    % The number of times a given control location 
    % inside a procedure is visited during the program execution.
    The upper bound on the number of times a given control location 
    inside a procedure is visited during program execution is referred to as the reachability-bound.
    %  by~\cite{GulwaniZ10} in the first place.
    % A tight reachability-bound
    % can help to improve the analysis result on other program features.
    % While computing a tight reachability-bound for a given program control location is challenging.
    % Many works in the program analysis area develop algorithms estimating the program's loop bound or overall complexity.
    % But there isn't a general analysis algorithm that
    % computes the reachability-bound
    % directly or path-sensitively.
    % To leverage these limitations,
    This paper presents a path-sensitive reachability-bound algorithm
    aiming to find a precise symbolic reachability-bound \todo{on the program's every control location path-sensitively}.
    %  in this paper.
    In comparison with previous methods, our algorithm brings together two lines of program complexity analysis techniques:
    1. amortized bound analysis through program abstraction and ranking function estimation, and
    2. loop summarization based multiple loop paths refinement.
    Built on the combination, we introduce two new quantities, \emph{path reachability-bound} and \emph{loop reachability-bound}.
    % combines them effectively. 
    This effective combination leverages the precision and efficiency trade-off between the two lines of techniques.
    It allows us to compute precise reachability-bound on each program point path-sensitively.
    We implement a prototype and report on an experimental comparison with state-of-art tools over four different benchmarks.
