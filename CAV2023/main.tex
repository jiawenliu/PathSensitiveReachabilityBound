\begin{abstract}
    % The upper bound on the number of times a given control location 
    % inside a procedure is visited during program execution is referred to as the reachability-bound.
    % This paper presents a path-sensitive reachability-bound algorithm
    % aiming to find a precise symbolic reachability-bound {for every control location inside a program}.
    % %  in this paper.
    % In comparison with previous methods, our algorithm brings together two lines of program complexity analysis techniques:
    % 1. amortized bound analysis through program abstraction and ranking function estimation, and
    % 2. loop summarization-based multiple loop paths refinement.
    % Built on this combination, we introduce two new quantities, \emph{path reachability-bound} and \emph{loop reachability-bound}.
    % This effective combination leverages the precision and efficiency trade-off between the two lines of techniques.
    % It allows us to compute precise reachability-bound on each program point path-sensitively.
    % We implement a prototype and report on an experimental comparison with state-of-art tools over four different benchmarks.
    Reachability-bound analysis aims at providing upper bounds on the number of times a given program location is visited during program execution.
    This paper presents a path-sensitive reachability-bound algorithm.
    In comparison with previous works, 
    our algorithm is the first one to exploit path-sensitivity to compute precise reachability-bounds for every program location.
    By doing this, we bring together two techniques from resource analysis:
    1. amortized bound analysis through program abstraction and ranking function estimation, and
    2. summarization-based multiple loop paths refinement.
    Building on this combination, we focus on two new quantities, \emph{path reachability-bound} and \emph{loop reachability-bound}, which allow us to leverage the precision and efficiency of the two techniques,
    and allow us to compute precise reachability-bounds for each program point in a path-sensitive way.
    We implemented our algorithm in a prototype and we report on an experimental comparison with state-of-art tools over four different sets of benchmarks.
