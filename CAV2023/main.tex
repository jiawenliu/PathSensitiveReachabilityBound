Goal: bound the number of visiting times for every program control location, i.e., Solve the 
\emph{Reachability-Bound Program}.
\\
Motivation: State-of-Art Techniques 
\\
in paper~\cite{Sumit2010rechability,sinn2017complexity} : path-insensitive 
\\
in paper~\cite{GulwaniJK09} : path-sensitive and precise for estimating loop bounds,
but over-approximate reachability times of control location as the loop bound.
\\
in paper~\cite{ZulegerGSV11} : able to identify different paths from multiple-path loop, but aims to solve bounds for loop and path. They over-approximate reachability times of control location with loop bound.
\\
Contributions: 
\\
1. Solve the 
\emph{Reachability-Bound Program} precisely /(improve accuracy),
in two challenging classes of programs: Programs with Path-Sensitive Loops, and Programs with Nested Loops 
\\
2. Improved efficiency by abstracting program using the Difference Constraint-base method in \cite{sinn2017complexity}.
\\
3. Efficient implementation and evaluation results.
