In this section, we discuss a running example extracted from the c base-class library with
challenges of computing the symbolic
\emph{reachability-bound} on
every control location and illustrate how our algorithm leverages the challenges through the \emph{path reachability-bound} and the \emph{loop reachability-bound}.
% This example

% \item 
\textbf{Challenge I}
The example program in Figure~\ref{ex:relatedNestedWhileOdd-overview}(a) has two level nested loops, outer loop $L_1$ and nested loop $L_4$ which is in the first path of $L_1$. Given $n \geq m \geq 0$,
the expected \emph{reachability-bound}s for locations in outer loop $3, 6, 7$ and $8$ are all $\lfloor\frac{m}{4}\rfloor$,
% for $8$ is $\lfloor\frac{m}{4}\rfloor + 1$,
for location $2$ is $\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\rfloor$ and $\lfloor\frac{m}{2}\rfloor + 1$ for location $1$.
\highlight{Though within the same loop $L_1$, the bounds for different locations are different.}
The amortized analysis methodology such as Loopus~\cite{SinnZV17}, KoAT~\cite{BrockschmidtEFFG14,FalkeKS12,FalkeKS11}, C4B~\cite{CarbonneauxHS15}, etc. ignores path sensitivity and approximate the bound $n$ as the bound for loop $L_1$. 
While some path-refinement-based methods such as \cite{GulwaniZ10,GulwaniJK09}, CoFloCo~\cite{Montoya17,Flores-Montoya16,Flores-MontoyaH14} and etc. only give the same bound for all the locations within the loop $L_1$. 
Though we can reuse their results i.e., loop bounds as the \emph{reachability-bound} for location $1$ and $2$,
but it is still unclear for locations $3, 6, 7$, and $8$.
%
This motivates our first key novelty -- the \emph{path reachability-bound} $\inoutB(\rprog, \tpath)$ for a loop-free and interleaving-free path $\tpath$.
It bounds the evaluation times of each path over a path-refined program.
% \item 

\textbf{Challenge II} The second challenge occurs in the nested loop.
In line 6, since $i$ is reset by $k + m$ and $k$ is reset by $i - m$ at line 3, the
loop $L_4$ is only executed in the first iteration of while loop $L_1$.
% \\
The total iterations of the two loops are
$n - m + \lfloor\frac{m}{2}\rfloor + 1$,
and the tight \emph{reachability-bound} for location $5$ inside the $L_4$ is $m$.
% for locations $4, 5$ and $8$ between the $L_3$ and $L_6$ are $(n-N) \times (m - N)$,
% and $n - N$ for locations $2$ and $9$.
% \\
\highlight{The tight \emph{reachability-bound}s for the locations inside the loop $L_4$ is 
the same as its innermost loop iteration bound.
% , as well as our \emph{path reachability-bound}.
However, for the locations between $L_1$ and $L_4$,
the tight bounds are the multiplication of the inner and outer loop iteration bounds.}
% \\
% compute a better but still loose bound, $n + m^2 - m \times N$ on total iteration times.
The existing approach either ignores the path sensitivity or computes the same bound for all the locations in a loop.
None of them can give the precise \emph{reachability-bound}s for different locations in the loop,
which is non-trivial to compute even though knowing the loop bound.
% especially for the locations similar to $7$ in $\kw{threeNestedWhile}$.
This motivates us to consider our second novel quantity --
the numbers of iterations of the outer loop $L_1$ such that,
during these iterations, the loop $L_4$ is ``entered''. 

We refer to this quantity as the \emph{loop reachability} of the loop $L_4$ w.r.t the outer loop $L_1$.
% of the location within loop $L_6$ w.r.t the loops $L_3$ and $L_1$.
By multiplying the \emph{path reachability-bound} of $\tpath_3$ within $L_4$,
with its \emph{loop reachability-bound} w.r.t $L_1$, we can obtain an accurate
\emph{reachability-bound} for location $5$.
This quantity isn't considered or computed in any of the previous works.
\cite{GulwaniJK09} considers a similar quantity, the \emph{Progress Invariant}. But it bounds the iteration times of inner loop $L_4$ w.r.t. one iteration of $L_1$, which is $m$. Then they still over-approximate the bound for locations inside $L_4$ as $m \times (n - m)$ by multiplication.
% \end{itemize}
With the two key novelties, our algorithm computes the reachability-bound for this example through the following steps.
