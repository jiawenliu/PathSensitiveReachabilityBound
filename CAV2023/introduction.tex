Gulwani et. al first introduce \emph{reachability-bound} as the upper bound on the number of times a given control location 
inside a procedure is visited during program execution in~\cite{GulwaniZ10}.
A tight reachability-bound has many applications.
For example from a privacy and security perspective,
how much secret information is leaked by a program depends on the number of times a certain operation that leaks the data
is executed~\cite{Malacaria07};
from an efficiency perspective, when different program locations consume different resources, a precise reachability-bound of each location can help to estimate the resource cost more accurate than just computing the overall complexity.
While most of the existing works have different limitations when inferring the \emph{reachability-bound}.
Gulwani et. al
gave a two-step solution by combining abstract interpretation and proof-rules-based techniques. However, they did not solve this problem in a path-sensitive manner.

~\cite{BrockschmidtEFFG16,AlbertAGP08,AliasDFG10,Flores-MontoyaH14} can be repurposed to estimate similar quantities such as the
bounds on loop iterations, execution time, etc.
While these quantities focus only on  
the overall complexity,
none of them compute the reachability-bound on a given program control location directly or path-sensitively.
This leads to inaccuracy in data leakage analysis, resource analysis, etc.

% \todo{Combine the next two limitations with the general limitations above}
To overcome these limitations and solve 
the reachability-bounds problem efficiently and path-sensitively, 
we introduce a novel path-sensitive reachability-bound analysis algorithm that is built over an abstract transition graph which effectively combines amortized complexity analysis with loop summarization based multipath refinement.
This combination mitigates the limitations faced by either technique individually. Below are some related works and their limitations.

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Program Abstraction.}

Program abstraction is commonly used in program analysis as a preprocessing step to abstract program features and generate transition graphs or systems. For example, \cite{GulwaniZ10} summarizes programs into abstract domains such as the unified lattice~\cite{CousotH78}, polyhedra~\cite{CousotC77} or octagonal~\cite{Mine06} domains and generates transition systems for counter variables.
\cite{KincaidCBR18} abstracts program into the wedge domain and computes the non-linear loop invariant.
%  While it only works well for the specific targeting problem.
The efficiency is the main bottleneck when generating and solving these constraints.
We choose to use the difference constraint based~\cite{SinnZV17,SinnZV14} program abstraction model combined with boolean expression abstraction to generate our abstract transition graph.
It is more accurate in the sense of representing the program loops path-sensitively. This representation is also comparatively lightweight.

\item \emph{Amortized Complexity Analysis.}

One line of complexity analysis follows the idea of the \emph{amortized complexity analysis} originated from Tarjan's influential paper~\cite{PotechinP17}. It is usually combined with ranking function~\cite{BradleyMS05,CookSZ13,Zuleger18} or counter increment as in~\cite{ZulegerGSV11,SinnZV14,SinnZV17,LuCT21,AliasDFG10}.
They do well in nested loops by alternating the loop bound computation with the ranking or counter estimation. This alternation is efficient without recursively unrolling the nested loops when composing the bound of different paths.
  % \\
  But estimating the counter or ranking function invariant ignores the interleaving between multiple paths in the same loop.
Most of them (including some existing tools CofloCo~\cite{Montoya17,Flores-MontoyaH14,Flores-Montoya16}, KoAT~\cite{BrockschmidtEFFG16,BrockschmidtEFFG14,FalkeKS12,FalkeKS11}, the algorithm in~\cite{LuCT21}) over-approximate the loop bound when the path interleaving affects loop execution. They give the entire loop bound path-insensitively as the reachability-bound on different points. Another kind of \emph{amortized complexity analysis} based on type refinement or annotation such as~\cite{CraryW00,JostHLH10,CicekBG0H17,RajaniG0021,CarbonneauxHS15} have the same weakness when considering the paths interleaving, and over-approximating the resource cost on different program points.

  To improve in the setting of multiple paths, our method combines this analysis with loop refinement techniques to complement its limitations.
\item
\emph{Loop Summarization and Path Refinement Based Complexity Analysis}

Another line of loop bound analysis through loop summarization and path refinement seeks for precise loop path representation~\cite{ManoliosV06,BalakrishnanSIG09,SharmaDDA11,Flores-MontoyaH14,HumenbergerJK18,CyphertBKR19}, and explicating the interleaving between paths~\cite{GulwaniJK09,ZulegerGSV11}.
\cite{KincaidBCR19} introduces a precise closed-form loop summarization techniques which can help to improve the accuracy of the path refinement, as well as the non-linear loop summarization techniques~\cite{KincaidCBR18} and the invariant generating algorithm considering recurrence in~\cite{BreckCKR20}. 
But the limitation occurs when composing the bound between nested loops in most works of this line, which recursively unrolls the nested loops. This is heavy and non-terminating in most cases.

We simplify the path refinement algorithm in~\cite{GulwaniJK09} using contextualization techniques of~\cite{ZulegerGSV11,SinnZV14}, which is originated from~\cite{ManoliosV06}.
We also limit the iterations of the refinement algorithm to a constant in our bound analysis algorithm.
\end{itemize}
%
We perform both path refinement and ranking estimation over an abstract transition graph through program abstraction presented in Section~\ref{sec:progabs}.
This combination utilizes the effectiveness of \emph{amortized complexity analysis} by computing the ranking function
% $\locbound(\absevent, c)$ for each transition edge $\absevent$, 
and estimating its bound invariant in Section~\ref{sec:rank}.
In the meantime, it benefits from the accuracy of path refinement techniques through a light-weight path refinement algorithm adopted from~\cite{GulwaniJK09} in Section~\ref{sec:refine}.
Building on this combination, we introduce two novel quantities,
the \emph{path reachability-bound} and \emph{loop reachability-bound}.
The first one bounds the evaluation times of each loop free and interleaving free path in a refined program, and the second one bounds the iterations of an outer loop w.r.t. the innermost loop such that in these iterations of outer loop, the innermost loop is ``entered''. 
Then we present the algorithm for estimating the two quantities in Section~\ref{sec:looprb} and~\ref{sec:pathrb} and compute the \emph{reachability-bound} for each program point path-sensitively in Section~\ref{sec:psrb}.
Our evaluation on the prototype implementation in Section~\ref{sec:eval} shows that we can accurately estimate different bounds for different program points on multiple loop paths. The main contributions are as follows.

\begin{itemize}
  \item 
1. A path-sensitive reachability-bound algorithm which computes sound bound on the evaluation times of each program point path-sensitively.
 \item 
2. The combination of \emph{amortized bound analysis} through ranking function estimation and the path refinement approach in our algorithm.
\item 
3. Two novel quantities, the \emph{path reachability-bound} and \emph{loop reachability-bound} and their corresponding estimating algorithms.
\item 
4. A prototype implementation with evaluation over four different benchmarks.
  The evaluation shows that we can compute different bounds on the evaluation times of different program points in the same loop accurately.
