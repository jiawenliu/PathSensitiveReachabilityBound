Similar to the loop bound computation,
we first compute two abstract states for each loop w.r.t. a simple transition path inside it,
$\lpinit(l: \rprog, \tpath, c)$, and $\lpnext(l: \rprog, \tpath, c)$ based on the refined program
as in Definition~\ref{def:alg-absstate}.
\begin{defn}[Loop Abstract States]
\label{def:alg-loopabsstate}
Given a program $c$ with its refined program $\rprog_c$ and a loop sub-program  and $l:\rprog$ in $\rprog_c$,
we compute four two abstract states for the ranking functions in this loop, 
   $\lpinit(l: \rprog, \tpath, c)$, and $\lpnext(l: \rprog, \tpath, c) \in \scexpr(c)$ as follows.
   \begin{itemize}%
   \item 
The loop initial state 
$\lpinit(l: \rprog, \tpath, c) \in \scexpr(c)$ computes a symbolic expression estimating the abstract initial value of $\tpath$'s ranking function before
any visit of $\tpath$ and during the first execution of $l: \rprog$.
\[
  \begin{array}{l}
    \lpinit(l: \rprog, \tpath, c) \triangleq 
  \arg\max_{l_1}
  \\
  \left\{
       \varinvar(y, c) + v ~\middle\vert~ 
       \begin{array}{l} 
         (l_1, x' \leq y + v, l_2) \in \reset(x, c) 
         \\
         \land \absinit(\rprog) \leq l_1 \leq \absinit(\tpath)
         \land
         x \in \left\{ \locbound(\absevent, c) | \absevent \in \tpath \right\}
       \end{array}
     \right\}
    \end{array}
    \]
\item
The loop next state 
$\lpnext(l: \rprog, \tpath, c) \in \scexpr(c)$ 
computes the amount of $\tpath$'s ranking function
that is is modified before
the second visit of $\tpath$ but during the second execution of $l: \rprog$.
%
\[
  \begin{array}{l}
  \lpnext(l: \rprog, \tpath, c) \triangleq 
  \max\limits_{x \in \left\{ \locbound(\absevent, c) | \absevent \in \tpath \right\}}
  \\
  \left\{
    \begin{array}{l}
  \sum\limits_{\absevent \in \inc(x, c) }
  \left\{ 
      v ~\middle\vert~ \absevent = (l', x' \leq x + v, \_) \land  l' \in \rprog 
      \land l' \notin \tpath \right\}
      \\ \qquad 
      + \arg\max\limits_{l_2 }
         \left\{ \varinvar(y, c) + v ~\middle\vert~ 
         (l_1, x' \leq y + v, l_2) \in \reset(x, c) \land l_1 \in \rprog \land l_1 \notin \tpath\right\}
     \\ \qquad 
      - \sum\limits_{ \absevent \in \dec(x, c) }\left\{ 
      v 
      ~\middle\vert~ \absevent = (l', x' \leq x + v, \_) \land l' \in \rprog \land l' \notin \tpath \right\}
      \\ \qquad 
      + BD(\kw{enclosed}(\tpath), c) \times \rfnext(\tpath, c)
    \end{array}
    \right\}
  \end{array}
  \]
    \end{itemize}
\end{defn}
%
Then we compute the
\emph{loop reachability-bound} as below.
% using the two states and the $\rffinal$.
\begin{defn}[Loop Reachability-bound Computation]
  \label{def:looprb}
  Given a refined program $\rprog$ and a simple transition path $\tpath$ in this program, 
  let $l: \rprog_l$ be a loop program in $\rprog$,
  then $l: \rprog_l$'s \emph{loop reachability-bound} w.r.t. $\tpath$, $\lpchB(l: \rprog, \tpath, c)$
  is computed interactively with the abstract loop states as follows. 
  \[
    \lpchB(l: \rprog, \tpath, c) \triangleq
    \frac{\lpinit(\rprog, \tpath, c) - \rffinal(\tpath, c)}{\lpnext(\rprog, \tpath, c)}
  \]
\end{defn}
%
\todo{How it is computed??}
$\lpchB(l: \rprog, \tpath)$
is a sound upper bound on iteration numbers of the outside loop $l$,
such that,
during these iterations, the nested loop $l' = \kw{enclosed(\tpath)}$ is executed, i.e., reached, formally as below.
%  with proof in \highlight{Appendix~\ref{apdx:looprb-sound}}.
\begin{lem}[Soundness of the Loop Reachability-Bound]
  \label{lem:looprb-sound}
  For any loop $l: \rprog$ and a simple transition path $\tpath$ in a refined program, if $l_t: \rprog_t$ is the closest loop enclosing the $\tpath$, then the entering times of $l_t: \rprog_t$ when executing the $l: \rprog$ under initial trace $\trace_0 \in \ftdom_0(c)$, is bounded by $\econfig{\lpchB(l: \rprog, \tpath, c)}(\trace_0)$.
  {\small
  \[
    \begin{array}{l}
    \forall c, c_l \in \cdom, \tpath \in \absG(c), \trace_0 \in \ftdom_0(c_l), \trace \in \tdom, l, l' \in \ldom, \rprog \st 
    \rprog = REFINE(\algrewrite(c))
    \\ \qquad
    \land l_t: \rprog_t = \kw{enclosed}(\rprog, \tpath)
    \land 
    \rprog = \algrewrite(c_l)
    \land
    \big(
    \config{c_l, \trace_0} \to^* \config{\clabel{\eskip}^{l'}, \trace_0 \tracecat \trace}
    \lor \config{c_l, \trace_0} \uparrow^{\infty} \trace_0 \tracecat \trace 
    \big)
    \\ \qquad
    \implies
    \econfig{\lpchB(l: \rprog, \tpath, c)}(\trace_0) 
    \\ \qquad \geq 
      \sum\big\{
      \lcounter(\trace, \tracel(\trace_{l \to l_t})) ~\vert~ \trace_{l \to l_t} \in 
      \big\{\trace_{l \to l_t} ~\vert~ 
      % \\ \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad
      \trace_{l \to l_t}, \trace' \in \ftdom, \trace'' \in \tdom
      \land \trace = \trace_{l \to l_t} \tracecat \trace''
      \\ \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad
      \land \trace_{l \to l_t} = [(\_, l, \etrue)] \tracecat \trace' \tracecat [(\_, l_t, \etrue)]
      \land \counter(\trace', l) = \counter(\trace', l_t) = 0 
      \big\}
      \big\}.
\end{array}

The $\lpchB(l:\rprog, \tpath)$ 
can also be over-approximated by
$I(l, l')$ through the progress invariant in paper\cite{GulwaniJK09}.
While $I(l, l')$ over-approximates this value largely
by estimating the bound on iteration numbers of $l'$ in one iteration of $l$.

In Example~\ref{ex:relatedNestedWhileOdd-overview}, since there is only two level nested loop,
the only interesting \emph{loop reachability-bound} are $\lpchB(\rprog_1^1, \tpath_3)$ and $\lpchB(1: \rprog_1^1, \tpath_3)$ 
w.r.t. $\tpath_3$ and its outside loop $1$. We illustrate Example~\ref{ex:threeNestedWhile} with three nested loop better show the precision of the \emph{loop reachability-bound}.
% We compute $1$ for both $\lpchB(\rprog_1^1, \tpath_3)$ and $\lpchB(1: \rprog_1^2, \tpath_3)$. It is tight and indicating there is only $1$ iteration of $\rprog_1^1$, also $\rprog_1^2$ such that the inner loop $4$ will be entered.
\begin{example}[Three Nested Loop]
  \label{ex:threeNestedWhile}
\input{examples/threeNestedWhile-overview}
In line 8, $i$ is reset by $w$ and $w$ is reset by $j$ at line 5. So the
while $L_6$ is only executed in the first iteration of while loop $L_1$ and $L_3$.
% \\
The while loop $L_3$ at line 3 is executed only in 
the first $m - N$ iterations of the 
$L_1$ because $j$ is reset by $i$ in line 2.
% \\
So the total iterations of all the three loops is
$n + m^2 - m \times N$,
and the precise \emph{reachability-bound} for location $7$ inside the $L_6$ is $N$,
for locations $4, 5$ and $8$ between the $L_3$ and $L_6$ are $(n-N) \times (m - N)$,
and $n - N$ for locations $2$ and $9$.
% \\
Notice here the \emph{reachability-bounds} for the locations inside the loop $L_6$ is 
the same as its innermost loop iteration bound.
% , as well as our \emph{path reachability-bound}.
However, for the locations between $L_3$ and $L_6$,
the \emph{reachability-bounds} are the multiplication of the inner and outer loop iteration bounds.
In order to precisely compute how many times the location $7$ is reached, it is critical to know
the numbers of iterations of the outside loop $L_3$ and $L_1$ such that,
during these iterations, the loop $L_6$ is ``entered'', which is exactly our \emph{loop reachability-bound}.

Again we first generate its abstract transition graph, $\absG(\kw{threeNestedWhile})$ in Figure~\ref{fig:threeWhile-overview}(a),
and compute its refined program,
$\rprog = \tpath_0; 1: \rprepeat(\tpath_1;$ 
$3: {\rprepeat(\tpath_2; 6 : {\rprepeat(\tpath_3)}; \tpath_4)}; \tpath_5);$ 
$\tpath_6$,
where the $\tpath_0, \ldots$ are shown in the middle part of Figure~\ref{fig:threeWhile-overview}(b).
We use $\rprog_1$ and $\rprog_3$ denote the body of the loop $L_1$ and $L_3$ respectively as in the bottom part of Figure~\ref{fig:threeWhile-overview}(b), and still compute the \emph{path reachability-bound} for each $\tpath_i$ but only w.r.t. the innermost loop it is nested.
Now we compute \emph{loop reachability-bound}, specifically for $\tpath_3$ w.r.t. each of its outer nested loops.
For $\tpath_3$ we compute
$\lpchB(1: \rprog_1, \tpath_3) = 1$ and
$\lpchB(3: \rprog_3, \tpath_3) = 1$.
Both are tight because loop $L_6$ will only be entered once among all iterations of $L_1$ and $L_3$, and in all the rest iterations, the body of loop $L_6$ isn't executed at all.
So $1$ as \emph{loop reachability-bound} of this path is tight w.r.t. both the loop $L_3$ and $L_1$.
% In the same way, we also compute $\lpchB(3: \rprog_3, \tpath_3) = 1$ precisely.
% Then for each $\tpath_i$, the multiplication of its \emph{path reachability-bound} with all its \emph{loop reachability-bound}s is an accurate \emph{loop reachability-bound} for the locations on this path.
\end{example}
