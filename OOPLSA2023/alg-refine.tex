The refinement relies on the external algorithm, summarized as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Rewrite the Program}
    It first rewrites the program $c$ by syntax in \cite{GulwaniJK09} and preserves the same semantics, based on $\absG(c)$.
\\
Each \emph{simple transition paths}, $\tpath \in \paths(\absG(c))$ in the rewritten program
corresponds to a path $\rho$ in the flatten program by Definition~4.1 in \cite{GulwaniJK09}.
%
It contains only the edges of atomic assignment or guard transition.
\item \textbf{Refined Program}
Then it computes the 
refined program, $\rprog$ by Algorithm~1 in paper~\cite{GulwaniJK09}.
\\
This step invokes the external algorithm REFINE from paper~\cite{GulwaniJK09} and compute the 
refined program $\rprog$ for a program $c$ given the input $c^{T}$.
\end{enumerate}
