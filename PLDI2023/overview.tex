In this section, we discuss two representative examples with
challenges of analyzing the symbolic bounds for the \emph{reachability-bound} problem.
We also give the technique overview of our algorithm.

\subsection{Multiple-Path Loop}
\label{sec:overview-multiplepath}
\input{examples/whileOdd}
Figure~\ref{fig:whileOdd}(a) shows an example of the multiple path loops
with different \emph{reachability-bound} on the control locations in different paths.
This example is adopted from the example in~\cite{Sumit2010rechability}, which
is a skeleton code from the .Net base-class library.
\\
In this example,
the precise \emph{reachability-bound} for control locations $3$ and $4$ are both $\frac{k}{4}$,
$\frac{k}{2}$ for location $2$, and $\frac{k}{2} + 1$ for location $1$.
\\
In order to know the locations $3$ and $4$ are reached at most $\frac{k}{4}$ times during program execution,
we need to know the commands at line $3$ and $4$ are executed alternatively after each other
during the iterations of the enclosed loop.
In the other words, neither of them is executed twice in 2 consecutive iterations.
\\
However, by paper~\cite{Sumit2010rechability} where the \emph{reachability-bound} problem is defined,
it can only derive the bound $k$ for location $3$ and $4$ because of the path-insensitivity in their method.
To best of my knowledge, there isn't any other later works on solving the \emph{reachability-bound} problem.
\\
Among the works on loop bound analysis, \cite{GulwaniJK09} can compute the precise global
loop bound (i.e., $\frac{k}{2}$) for this example path-sensitively.
Using this global bound, we can compute the precise reachability-bound for location $1$ and $2$.
However, the reachability-bounds for control locations $3$ and $4$ are still unclear.
% In order to know location $3$ and $4$ are executed $\frac{k}{4}$,
% we need to know location $3$ and $4$ is executed alternatively after each other.
% In other words, neither of them is executed twice in 2 consecutive iterations.
% \\
% We need to generate the repeat patterns containing the two execution paths reflecting this property.
% % However, this execution path corresponds to two iterations of the while loop.

% Then, we recover the \emph{reachability-bound} of location $3$ and $4$ globally from the

\paragraph*{Outside-In Algorithm}
The first key idea of this path-sensitive \emph{reachability-bound} analysis algorithm is the \emph{outside-in} algorithm.
\\
This algorithm combines the idea of \emph{Difference Constraint} based program abstraction method from \cite{sinn2017complexity}
and the while loop refinement algorithm ~\cite{GulwaniJK09} efficiently.
It first abstracts the program based on the Difference Constraint and refines every while loop for this constraint program.
Each refined while loop in the program is composed of all possible repeat patterns.
The repeat pattern can be one single execution path,
or is composed of one or more execution paths, or nested repeat pattern.
Then for every repeat pattern
%  execution path, 
the \emph{outside-in} algorithm
computes the local bound for it,
%  w.r.t to every repeat pattern
%  of the execution paths for 
in the direction
from the outermost repeat pattern to the innermost repeat pattern.
\\
% and the while loop refinement~\cite{GulwaniJK09}.
For this $\kw{whileOdd}$ example, the \emph{Outside-In} algorithm generates 
the repeat patterns containing the two execution paths reflecting this property.
There are 4 possible repeat patterns for this example:
\\
$\rprepeat(2 \to 3 \to 1; 2 \to 4 \to 1)$.
\\
$\rprepeat(2 \to 3 \to 1; 2 \to 4 \to 1)$.
\\
$2 \to 3 \to 1$
\\
$2 \to 4 \to 1$.
\\
\emph{Outside-In} computes the bound for every repeat pattern
as $\frac{k}{4}$, $\frac{k}{4}$, $1$, and $1$ respectively.
\\
Then in the next step, we recover the \emph{reachability-bound} of location $3$ and $4$ globally from the
repeat pattern and the enclosed loops through the \emph{Inside-Out} Algorithm.
\subsection{Nested Loops with Related Iterator}
\label{sec:overview-nestedwhile}
% Even though with the local bound computed for every repeat pattern,
Recovering the \emph{reachability-bound} of location is the other challenge, even though with
the local bound computed for every repeat pattern.
Figure~\ref{fig:threeWhile}(a) shows an example of the nested loops with related 
iterators.
This example is adopted from the example in~\cite{GulwaniJK09}, which is common in product code.
\\
% We first compute the local bound for the only one execution path $6 \to 7$ in $LOOP_6$ as $N$ by the \emph{Outside-In} algorithm.
% %
% Then i
In line 8, $i$ is reset by $w$ and $w$ is reset by $j$ at line 5. So the
while $LOOP_6$ is only executed in the first iteration of while loop $LOOP_1$ and $LOOP_3$.
\\
The while loop $LOOP_3$ at line 3 is executed only in 
the first $m - N$ iterations of the 
$LOOP_1$ because $j$ is reset by $i$ in line 2.
\\
So the total combined iterations of all the three loops is bounded above by 
$n + m^2 - m \times N$.
And the precise global reachability-bound for location $7$ inside the $LOOP_6$ is $N$,
for locations $4, 5$ and $8$ between the $LOOP_3$ and $LOOP_6$ are $(n-N) \times (m - N)$,
and locations $2$ and $9$ are $n - N$.
Notice here the global reachability-bounds for the location inside the loop $LOOP_6$ is 
the same as its local loop bound,
but for locations between $LOOP_3$ and $LOOP_6$ are the multiplication of the local loop bounds.
\\
So far, the loop bound analysis method in \cite{GulwaniJK09} is able to give
an approximation for the $n + (m \times n) + N$. 
The DC-based algorithm in \cite{sinn2017complexity} is able to
compute the precise combined loop bound of $n + m^2 - m \times N$.
\\
But knowing the global loop bound isn't enough to solve the \emph{reachability-bound problem} for locations in nested loops,
especially the locations which are similar to $7$ in $\kw{threeNestedWhile}$ example.
\\
% However, i
% In order to solve the \emph{reachability-bound problem} for locations inside
In order to how many times the locations inside
$LOOP_6$ is reached globally, we need to know
how many iterations of the $LOOP_3$ and $LOOP_1$, 
during which the $LOOP_6$ is executed.
Then multiply the local bound of $LOOP_6$ with the iterations during which it can be touched.
\\
The \emph{Progress Invariant} method in \cite{GulwaniJK09} is only able to compute
the loop bound for $LOOP_6$ inside $LOOP_3$ and $LOOP_1$.
So we have to over-approximate the global bound for $LOOP_6$ with the
overall program complexity, i.e., $n + m^2 - m \times N$.
\\
For the same reason, the DC-based algorithm in \cite{sinn2017complexity}
is only able to
compute the precise combined loop bound and the local bound of each loop
separately as well.
We are still unable to know the  \emph{reachability-bound} for the locations in the innermost loop.
% \\
\paragraph*{Inside-Out Algorithm}
The second key idea of this path-sensitive reachability analysis algorithm is the
\emph{inside-out} algorithm.
This algorithm computes an \emph{Inside-Out} bound on number of the iterations for
every nested outside loop w.r.t. the innermost loop of every control location.
Such that during these iterations, the innermost loop is touched. 
% the for every program control location,
% how many times the innermost loop of this control location will be touched w.r.t. every
% outside loop it is nested in.
This is distinguished from the traditional methods, which compute the local bound
of the innermost loop w.r.t. the outside loop in which it is nested.
%
\\
For the example $\kw{threeNestedWhile}$, 
we compute the \emph{Inside-Out} bound for $LOOP_1$ and $LOOP_3$
w.r.t. the $LOOP_6$ as follows,
$InOut(LOOP_1, LOOP_6) = 1$.
\\
$InOut(LOOP_3, LOOP_6) = 1$.
Then, we combine this result with the local bound
computed from the \emph{Outside-In} algorithm.
For the only one path $6 \to 7$ in $LOOP_6$, 
we compute the accurate reachability bound $N$.
\\
The derivation of the reachability bound for location $6$ and $7$
on this path is straightforward in the last step.
